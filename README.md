1.Floor and Ceil in Sorted Array-->
Given a sorted array nums and an integer x. Find the floor and ceil of x in nums. The floor of x is the largest element in the array which is smaller than or equal to x. The ceiling of x is the smallest element in the array greater than or equal to x. If no floor or ceil exists, output -1.


Example 1

Input : nums =[3, 4, 4, 7, 8, 10], x= 5

Output: 4 7

Explanation: The floor of 5 in the array is 4, and the ceiling of 5 in the array is 7.

Example 2

Input : nums =[3, 4, 4, 7, 8, 10], x= 8

Output: 8 8

Explanation: The floor of 8 in the array is 8, and the ceiling of 8 in the array is also 8.

Now your turn!

Input : nums = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14], x= 1

Output:

Pick your answer


[2, 14]

[-1, 2]

[-1, 14]

[2, -1]
Constraints

  1 <= nums.length <= 105 
  0 < nums[i], x < 105 
  nums is sorted in ascending order.


2.Ceil in a Sorted Array-->
Given a sorted array arr[] and an integer x, find the index (0-based) of the smallest element in arr[] that is greater than or equal to x. This element is called the ceil of x. If such an element does not exist, return -1.

Note: In case of multiple occurrences of ceil of x, return the index of the first occurrence.

Examples

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 8, 10, 11, 12, 19], x = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Smallest number greater than 5 is 8, whose index is 2.
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 8, 10, 11, 12, 19], x = 20
Output: -1
Explanation: No element greater than 20 is found. So output is -1.
Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 2, 8, 10, 11, 12, 19], x = 0
Output: 0
Explanation: Smallest number greater than 0 is 1, whose indices are 0 and 1. The index of the first occurrence is 0.
Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 106
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 106
0 ≤ x ≤ arr[n-1]


3.Floor in a Sorted Array-->
Given a sorted array arr[] and an integer x, find the index (0-based) of the largest element in arr[] that is less than or equal to x. This element is called the floor of x. If such an element does not exist, return -1.

Note: In case of multiple occurrences of floor of x, return the index of the last occurrence.

Examples

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 8, 10, 10, 12, 19], x = 5
Output: 1
Explanation: Largest number less than or equal to 5 is 2, whose index is 1.
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 8, 10, 10, 12, 19], x = 11
Output: 4
Explanation: Largest Number less than or equal to 11 is 10, whose indices are 3 and 4. The index of last occurrence is 4.
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 8, 10, 10, 12, 19], x = 0
Output: -1
Explanation: No element less than or equal to 0 is found. So, output is -1.
Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 106
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 106
0 ≤ x ≤ arr[n-1]
